## 🤖 Auto-Sync Setup

This repo uses GitHub Actions to automatically update stats and the problem index every day. Here's how it works:

```
Schedule (peridically as determined in the yml file)
        ↓
Fetch LeetCode GraphQL API
        ↓
Update README markers
        ↓
git commit & push
```

To set it up in your fork:
1. Go to **Settings → Secrets → Actions**
2. Add secret: `LEETCODE_USERNAME` = your LeetCode handle
3. The workflow in `.github/workflows/update-leetcode.yml` does the rest
